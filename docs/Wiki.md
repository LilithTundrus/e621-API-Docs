# Wiki

For e621, wikis are little information pieces about artists, species or a specific subject. They are typically short and only provide information relating to their given topicin the context of e621.

The wiki endpoints are very unstable/buggy and should likely not be used for any serious work with the API.

You can find the official docs [here](https://e621.net/help/show/api#wiki).
